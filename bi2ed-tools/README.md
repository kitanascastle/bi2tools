# Project Title

Battle Isle Tools

## Description

The tools that I have used to understand the various Battle Isle file formats.
Originally this have been many small tools which I now compiled into a single
more user-friendly tool.

## Getting Started

### System requirements

- Microsoft Windows XP/2003/Vista/Win7/Win8/Win10
- ca 1 MB free disk space (up to a few GB if you want to extract all the Battle Isle libraries)
- PowerBasic Console Compiler - PBCC 6.0

If you just want to use the extractor tool without compiling it first, you can
download the latest executable from:
https://www.kitana.org/arena/bi2/bi2editor.html

### Installation

Copy the executable to any folder on your hard drive.

### Executing program

Run BI2Extractor.exe

## Operation

Drag and drop the files that you want to extract onto the application window.
The press the "Extract" button.
